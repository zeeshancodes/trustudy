<h2>9. Warranties</h2>

<p>9.1 The Nepal Consumer Protection Act protects consumers by giving them certain guaranteed rights when they buy goods and services. For example, it requires that goods must be free of defects and do what they are meant to do.</p>

<p>Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Nepal Consumer Protection Act. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a &quot;major failure&quot; if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a &quot;major failure&quot;. Consumer Guarantees have no set time limit &ndash; depending upon the price and quality of goods, consumers may be entitled to a remedy after any manufacturer&#39;s warranty or extended warranty has expired. Where you return goods because they are defective or otherwise falling short of the Consumer Guarantees, then we will reimburse you the charges associated with returning the goods.</p>

<p>9.2 We aim, but do not guarantee, to process refunds and replacements within the later of 30 days of receipt by us of your returned original product (where applicable) or notification of our acceptance of your claim of a defect (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld).</p>

<h2>10. Disclaimer</h2>

<p>10.1 To the extent permissible at law this Service and all materials are provided on an &quot;as is&quot; and &quot;as available&quot; basis, without warranties of any kind other than those prescribed under the Nepal Consumer Protection Act or other applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permissible at law we disclaim all warranties regarding title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement of intellectual property rights. Where legislation (including the Nepal Consumer Protection Act) implies any condition or warranty, and that legislation prohibits us from excluding or modifying the application of, or our liability under, any such condition or warranty, that condition or warranty will be deemed included but our liability and the remedies available to you will be limited to the extent permissible at law.</p>

<p>10.2 We do not make any representations or warranties that your access to the Service and materials will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error free.</p>

<p>10.3 You accept that information on this Service (including materials) is provided or relayed by us is general information and is not in the nature of advice and is not guaranteed to be error-free.</p>

<p>10.4 To the extent permissible at law, we exclude liability for any loss, damage or injury however caused (including through negligence), which you may directly or indirectly suffer in connection with your use of this Service, any other linked website or materials nor do we accept responsibility for any such loss arising out of your use of or reliance thereon. Without limiting the foregoing, to the extent permissible at law we exclude liability in respect of:</p>

<p>1. Mistakes or inaccuracies on the Service or in Materials;</p>

<p>2. Any unauthorized access to or use of secure servers and/or personal information and/or financial information stored on those servers;</p>

<p>3. Bugs, viruses, trojan horses or other harmful code which may be transmitted to or through our Service by a third party; or</p>

<p>4. Any interruption or cessation of transmission from our Service.</p>

<p>10.5 To the extent permissible at law, in no circumstance will we be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special and/or consequential losses or damage (including loss of profits, revenue, production, goodwill, data or opportunity, or any physical injury) of any nature arising through or as a result of your use of the Service or any materials or other goods/ services purchased through it.</p>

<p>10.6 We reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you&#39;re paying for.</p>

<p>10.7 The Learn Python - Trustudy app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It&#39;s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone&#39;s security features and it could mean that the Learn Python - Trustudy app won&#39;t work properly or at all.</p>

<p>10.8 You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don&#39;t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don&#39;t have any of your data allowance left.</p>

<p>10.9 If you&#39;re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you&#39;re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you&#39;re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

<p>10.10 Along the same lines, we cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged &ndash; if it runs out of battery and you can&#39;t turn it on to avail the Service, we cannot accept responsibility.</p>

Amazon, the Amazon logo, AmazonSupply, and the AmazonSupply logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.</p>

<p>10.11 At some point, we may wish to update the Apps. The Apps are currently available on Android &amp; iOS &ndash; the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you&#39;ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Trustudy does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>

<p>11.1 The Service may contain links to other websites, including but not limited to those of third party supplier and providers (&quot;linked websites&quot;). Those links are provided for convenience only and may not remain current or be maintained. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices associated with linked websites.</p>

<p>11.2 Our links with linked websites should not be construed as an endorsement, approval or recommendation by us of the owners or operators of those linked websites, or of any information, graphics, materials, products or services referred to or contained on those linked websites, unless and to the extent stipulated or implied to the contrary.</p>

<p>11.3 Responsibility for the content of any advertisements appearing on the Service rests solely with the advertisers. The placement of an advertisement does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement by us of the advertiser&#39;s products and each advertiser is solely responsible for any representations made in connection with its advertisements.</p>

<h2>12. Indemnity</h2>

<p>12.1 You agree to fully indemnify and hold us (and our directors and officers) harmless against any expenses, costs, loss or damage (including consequential loss) that we may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your use of the Service and any breach of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
